## [YUNG’s HyDungeons](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/yungs-hydungeons)
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

**Description:**  
YUNG's HyDungeons adds new procedurally generated dungeons to the game!  

These dungeons are instanced and can only be accessed via the Ancient Portal, unlockable at 100 Memories.  
<sup>(If you're a server op, you can just use the in-game Instances list or /inst command to teleport directly to the instance.)</sup>   

Once Hytale fully embraces v2 worldgen, I'll work on making these structures appear naturally in the world instead.  

Currently there is only one dungeon, but I plan on adding more structures and increasing structure complexity as the game's tooling for procedurally generated structures improves!  

Please note that this is very early access, so the loot may not be properly balanced. This will be addressed as the vanilla game's progression is more clearly defined over time.

## [Wan’s Wonder Weapons](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wans-wonder-weapons)
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

**Description:**  
Wan’s Wonder Weapons adds a collection of powerful, one-of-a-kind relic weapons to Hytale.  
These are not ordinary arms, but ancient artifacts shaped by lost civilizations, elemental forces, and forgotten magic. Each weapon carries a fragment of history, once wielded by liches, bound to nature itself, forged in stellar collapse, or salvaged from cursed ruins.  

Every relic is designed to feel distinct in theme and effect, rewarding players who seek legendary tools rather than mass-produced gear. Some weapons bend the elements, others command life and death, and a few exist purely because the world of Hytale leaves room for the absurd.  

For now, all relics follow the current highest-tier crafting balance available in the game (Mithryl), but require Onyxium as their core material, reinforcing their status as rare and powerful artifacts.
